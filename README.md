# Python Userservice Client

## What does it do?

This provides a client library for the UserUp Userservice. The Userservice utlizes gRPC and this library adds a very thin wrapper around the generated clients.

## Building for development

This project uses [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) for building and maintaining the environment. Once hatch is installed, the Makefile can be used to see different commands.
